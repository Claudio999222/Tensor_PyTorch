# PyTorch Tensors

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of tensors in PyTorch, a powerful library for deep learning and machine learning tasks. PyTorch tensors are multidimensional arrays that facilitate the process of building and training neural networks. This repository covers various aspects of PyTorch tensors, including their creation, manipulation, and application in machine learning models.

## Features

- **Introduction to Tensors**: Understand the basics of tensors, their structure, and how they differ from regular arrays and matrices.
- **Tensor Operations**: Learn about various tensor operations such as indexing, slicing, reshaping, and mathematical computations.
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Explore how PyTorch's autograd module provides automatic differentiation for all tensor operations, crucial for backpropagation in neural networks.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Demonstrate how to leverage GPU acceleration for tensor computations to significantly improve performance.
- **Practical Examples**: Implement practical examples and tutorials to illustrate the usage of tensors in real-world scenarios, including deep learning applications.
